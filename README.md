Squares is created as a one stop-shop to store online resources. These resources can include anything from a personal reading list to an environmental scanning log for your project.

## How to Use

After creating an account and logging into Squares, to add a new resource to the dashboard, click the (+) button located at the top right of the application. 

The only input the user needs to provide is the url of your resource. All other information is scraped from the url meta tags and populated in the application. All information in the dashboard can be updated though if the user is not satisfied with what Squares provides the user by clicking the pencil icon on the resource card. Furthermore, users can delete a resource by clicking the X icon, or they can visit the resource by clicking the globe icon.
